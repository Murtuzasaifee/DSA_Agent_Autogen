# DSA Agent Autogen

A powerful Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problem-solving system built with Microsoft AutoGen framework. This project creates an intelligent multi-agent system that can understand, solve, and execute DSA problems with automatic code generation and testing.

## 🚀 Features

- **Multi-Agent Architecture**: Utilizes AutoGen's agent framework with specialized roles
- **Problem Solver Expert**: AI agent specialized in DSA problem analysis and solution design
- **Code Executor Agent**: Secure Docker-based code execution environment
- **Interactive Web Interface**: Streamlit-based UI for easy problem submission
- **Automatic Testing**: Generates and runs test cases for solutions
- **Solution Persistence**: Automatically saves working solutions as Python files
- **Real-time Streaming**: Live updates during problem-solving process

## 🏗️ Architecture

The system consists of two main agents working in collaboration:

### 1. Problem Solver Expert
- Analyzes DSA problems and designs optimal solutions
- Generates Python code with comprehensive test cases
- Provides detailed explanations of algorithms and complexity
- Handles error correction and code optimization

### 2. Code Executor Agent
- Executes code in a secure Docker container
- Manages dependencies and library installations
- Provides execution feedback and error reporting
- Handles file operations and output generation

## 📋 Prerequisites

- Python 3.12 or higher
- Docker installed and running
- OpenAI API key

## 🛠️ Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd DSA_Agent_Autogen
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -e .
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory:
   ```env
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
   ```

4. **Ensure Docker is running**
   ```bash
   docker --version
   ```

## 🚀 Usage

### Option 1: Streamlit Web Interface (Recommended)

1. **Start the application**
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Access the web interface**
   - Open your browser and navigate to the Streamlit URL (typically `http://localhost:8501`)
   - Enter your DSA problem in the text input field
   - Click "Solve" to start the problem-solving process
   - Watch the real-time conversation between agents

### Option 2: Command Line Interface

1. **Edit the main.py file**
   ```python
   async def main():
       # Uncomment and modify the CLI section
       task = 'Write a Python function to implement binary search'
       await run_team(task)
       
       # Comment out the Streamlit section
       # await load_app()
   ```

2. **Run the application**
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## 🔧 Configuration

### Model Configuration
Edit `src/dsa_agent/configs/constants.py` to customize:

```python
MODEL = 'gpt-4o'                    # OpenAI model to use
TEXT_MENTION_TERMINATION = 'STOP'   # Termination keyword
DOCKER_WORK_DIR = 'tmp'             # Docker working directory
DOCKER_TIMEOUT = 120                # Execution timeout (seconds)
MAX_TURNS = 15                      # Maximum conversation turns
```

### Agent Behavior
Modify agent system messages in:
- `src/dsa_agent/agents/problem_solver_agent.py` - Problem solver behavior
- `src/dsa_agent/agents/code_executor_agent.py` - Code executor configuration

## 📝 Example Problems

The system can handle various DSA problems:

- **Array Problems**: Two Sum, Maximum Subarray, Merge Intervals
- **String Problems**: Longest Palindrome, Anagram Detection
- **Tree Problems**: Binary Tree Traversal, Lowest Common Ancestor
- **Graph Problems**: BFS, DFS, Shortest Path
- **Dynamic Programming**: Fibonacci, Knapsack, Coin Change
- **Sorting & Searching**: Quick Sort, Binary Search, Merge Sort

## 🔍 How It Works

1. **Problem Input**: User submits a DSA problem through the interface
2. **Analysis**: Problem Solver Expert analyzes the problem and designs a solution
3. **Code Generation**: Agent generates Python code with test cases
4. **Execution**: Code Executor Agent runs the code in a Docker container
5. **Validation**: Results are validated and errors are handled
6. **Iteration**: Agents collaborate to fix issues and optimize solutions
7. **Solution Saving**: Final working solution is saved as `solutions.py`
8. **Explanation**: Detailed explanation of the solution and complexity analysis

## 🛡️ Security Features

- **Docker Isolation**: All code execution happens in isolated Docker containers
- **Timeout Protection**: Execution timeout prevents infinite loops
- **Resource Limits**: Docker containers have resource constraints
- **Safe File Operations**: Controlled file system access

   ```

2. **OpenAI API key not set**
   ```bash
   # Check if .env file exists and contains OPENAI_API_KEY
   cat .env
   ```

3. **Port already in use (Streamlit)**
   ```bash
   # Kill process using port 8501
   lsof -ti:8501 | xargs kill -9
   ```

4. **Module import errors**
   ```bash
   # Reinstall in development mode
   pip install -e .
   ```
